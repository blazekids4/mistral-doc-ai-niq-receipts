# Choosing the Right Tool for Receipt Analysis

| Service | What it Does | Ideal For | Strengths | Core Features |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Azure AI Document Intelligence** | Extracts text, key-value pairs, tables, and layout from structured, semi and unstructured documents, field extraction with grounding, confidence, support for classification and splitting | Standard forms, invoices, receipts, purchase orders, IDs, contracts, legal documents | Proven, high-accuracy extraction, consistency, low latency, confidence score and grounding, predefined schemas for many document types | OCR/Read/Layout models, Prebuilt Models (invoice, tax, receipt, etc.), Custom model (extraction and classification) |
| **Azure AI Content Understanding** | Processes documents, images, audio, and video; integrated reasoning for complex tasks, richer field extraction with built-in support for validation, enrichment, and post processing | Complex document processing requiring extractive and inferred fields, document formats with large number of complex variations or truly unstructured documents, inferring, summarization and generate metadata | Built-in unified process for multimodal inputs with zero shot model. Unified process for multimodal inputs, handles varying templates and unstructured documents, supports continuous improvement with labeled samples | Support for content extraction (OCR, layout), field extraction, inferred fields and classification for handling complex, large documents with high variations, reasoning with multi-file inputs and knowledge base |
| **Build your own solution with Azure AI Foundry Service** | Build a solution with any Azure-hosted LLM models, Fully control on model, prompt and tools | Developers aiming to build, own and manage a solution that requires fine grained control on models, costs and prompts | Maximum flexibility and control | Multiple options to plug and play with model choice, prompt tuning, workflow definition with complete flexibility in building each component |
