# Receipt Analysis Agent Workflows

## Overview

The agent workflows provide intelligent, multi-agent receipt processing with automatic quality assessment, smart routing, and comprehensive output tracking. Each workflow run generates detailed outputs including individual agent results, aggregation decisions, and an **LLM-powered analysis report**.

## Workflows

### 1. Intelligent Routing Workflow (`receipt_analysis_workflow.py`)

**Purpose**: Assesses image quality and routes receipts to the optimal processing agent(s).

**How It Works**:
1. **Quality Assessment**: Azure OpenAI analyzes each receipt image
2. **Smart Routing**:
   - **Clear images** â†’ Mistral Document AI (best for high-quality OCR)
   - **Blurry images** â†’ Azure Document Intelligence (better for poor quality)
   - **Uncertain quality** â†’ All 3 agents (consensus mode)
3. **Processing**: Selected agent(s) extract receipt data
4. **Aggregation**: Results are synthesized with field-level attribution
5. **Analysis Report**: LLM generates comprehensive run analysis

**Run Command**:
```bash
python run_workflow.py
```

### 2. All-Agents Workflow (`receipt_analysis_all_agents.py`)

**Purpose**: Processes every receipt with all three agents for maximum accuracy through consensus.

**How It Works**:
1. **Dispatch**: Each receipt is sent to all 3 agents simultaneously
2. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Azure Document Intelligence
   - Mistral Document AI
   - Azure OpenAI Vision (Direct Extraction)
3. **Aggregation**: Best fields from each agent are merged
4. **Analysis Report**: LLM generates comprehensive run analysis

**Run Command**:
```bash
python run_workflow.py --all-agents
```

## Output Structure

Each workflow run creates a timestamped directory with 5 output directories:

```
data/workflow_runs/{run_id}/
â”œâ”€â”€ receipts/                           # Final aggregated results
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ {receipt_name}.json            # Structured receipt data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {receipt_name}.md              # Human-readable summary
â”œâ”€â”€ intermediary_outputs/               # Individual agent outputs

## Aggregation Logic

When multiple agents process the same receipt, results are aggregated using:

### Scoring Algorithm

```
Score = (Completeness Ã— 0.7) + (Confidence Ã— 0.3) + Source Priority
```

- **Completeness**: Percentage of fields successfully extracted
- **Confidence**: Agent-reported confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- **Source Priority**: Tiebreaker (Document Intelligence > Mistral > Direct)

### Field Selection

1. Start with the highest-scoring agent's results as the base
2. Fill in missing fields from other agents
3. Track which agent provided each field (source attribution)

### Item Deduplication

- Merge item lists from all agents
- Remove duplicates based on description similarity
- Track which agent contributed each item

## Troubleshooting

### No Analysis Report Generated

**Symptom**: Workflow completes but no `RUN_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` file.

**Possible Causes**:
- Azure OpenAI not configured (check `.env`)
- No receipts processed successfully
- Insufficient API quota

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify Azure OpenAI configuration
echo $env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
echo $env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT

# Check workflow logs
cat data/workflow_runs/{run_id}/workflow.log | grep "analysis"
```

### All Receipts Routed to "Uncertain"

**Symptom**: Every receipt uses all 3 agents even when images seem clear.

**This is normal**: The quality assessor is conservative. If genuinely uncertain, it's better to use all agents than risk poor extraction.

**To investigate**:
- Check quality assessment reasoning in logs
- Review image quality (resolution, contrast, blur)
- Adjust quality assessment prompt if needed

### Low Confidence Scores

**Symptom**: Analysis report shows many low confidence results.

**Possible Causes**:
- Poor image quality (blur, low resolution)
- Unusual receipt formats
- Missing critical information on receipts

**Solution**:
- Implement image preprocessing
- Add receipt format training data
- Use all-agents mode for maximum accuracy

### Missing Fields

**Symptom**: Some receipts missing certain fields (e.g., transaction_time).

**This is normal**: Not all receipts contain all fields. Check:
1. Analysis report "Data Quality Assessment" section
2. Aggregation context to see if any agent extracted the field
3. Original receipt image to confirm field presence

## Performance Optimization

### Speed vs Accuracy Trade-offs

| Mode | Speed | Accuracy | Cost | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|------|----------|
| Intelligent Routing | Fast | Good | Low | Production, clear images |
| All-Agents | Slow | Best | High | Critical data, uncertain quality |
| Single Agent | Fastest | Variable | Lowest | Testing, known formats |

### Batch Processing Tips

1. **Test Mode First**: Always run with `TEST_MODE=true` initially
2. **Monitor Costs**: Check Azure consumption after each run
3. **Tune Concurrency**: Adjust based on API rate limits
4. **Review Analysis Reports**: Use insights to optimize future runs
